# Web-MLR

## Overview

Web-MLR is an attempt to recreate [mlr](http://parallelogram.cc/mlrv/), the live sample-cutting instrument, with cutting-edge native web technologies.

The [original MLR](http://monome.org/docs/app:mlr) was the first killer app for the [monome](http://monome.org/devices/). Web-MLR seeks to recreate MLR, built from the ground up to run natively in the browser. It is based around the cutting-edge [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/).

## Usage

A live demo should be up shortly. If you want to run it on your own machine, it is a Rails 4.0 app running on Ruby 2.0.
